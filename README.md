Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) involves a series of steps and techniques to understand and analyze a dataset. While it doesn't rely on specific mathematical formulas, it utilizes statistical measures and visualizations. Here are the typical steps in EDA with some associated statistical measures:

1. Data Collection: Gather the dataset from reliable sources.

2. Data Cleaning:

Identify and count missing values (NaN or NULL).
Formula: Missing Value Percentage = (Number of Missing Values / Total Number of Values) x 100%

3. Data Summarization:
Calculate summary statistics, including:
Mean (average)
Median (middle value)
Mode (most frequent value)
Variance (average of squared differences from the mean)
Standard Deviation (square root of variance)

4. Data Visualization:
Create visualizations such as histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and bar charts to explore data distributions, relationships, and patterns.

5. Correlation Analysis:
Compute correlation coefficients (e.g., Pearson correlation) or create scatter plots to assess relationships between pairs of variables.
Formula: Pearson Correlation Coefficient = [Σ(X - X̄)(Y - Ȳ)] / [√Σ(X - X̄)² * Σ(Y - Ȳ)²]

6. Feature Engineering:
Create new variables or features based on domain knowledge or relationships between existing variables.

7. Data Transformation:
Apply transformations like log, square root, or z-score normalization to make data more suitable for analysis.
Formula: Z-Score = (X - μ) / σ, where X is a data point, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation.

8. Univariate Analysis:
Analyze each variable individually to understand its distribution, including skewness and kurtosis.
Formulas: Skewness = [Σ(X - X̄)³ / (n * σ³)] and Kurtosis = [Σ(X - X̄)⁴ / (n * σ⁴)]

9. Bivariate Analysis:
Explore relationships between pairs of variables using scatter plots or correlation matrices.

10. Multivariate Analysis:
Consider interactions between multiple variables through techniques like factor analysis or principal component analysis (PCA).

11. Hypothesis Testing:
If applicable, perform hypothesis tests (e.g., t-tests, ANOVA) to validate assumptions or compare group means.

12. Outlier Detection:
Identify and handle outliers using statistical tests (e.g., IQR) or visualization techniques.

13. Data Reduction:
Reduce data dimensionality, if necessary, through techniques like dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA) or feature selection.

14. Pattern Recognition:
Identify any recurring patterns or trends in the data that may have implications for decision-making.

15. Report and Documentation:
Document your findings, insights, and any data transformations or preprocessing steps.
Remember that EDA is a flexible and iterative process that adapts to the specific characteristics and goals of the dataset. While formulas play a role in calculating certain statistics, the process as a whole relies heavily on visualization and statistical analysis techniques.
